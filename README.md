* Open the LaunchTile window with Strg+Q (âŒ˜+E on MacOS) and start searching
* Results can be navigated using the keyboard (arrow keys + enter)
* Bookmarklets are detected as such and run in the context of the currently open tab
* Additionally, larger JavaScript snippets can be managed on the options page
* Initially, without search query, the most recently created bookmarks are shown
